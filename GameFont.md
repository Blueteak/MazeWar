#Game Font

##Intro
Finding the correct font is an important part in creating a convincing replica of the original Maze War. To do this, we need to look at the machine in which the application was running (Xerox Alto) and reference material of the application itself.

##Xerox Alto
The alto is now basically a relic, so access to one is impracticle and ultimately unhelpful unless a new font is to be created. Interestingly, the source code for the Alto is freely available here: http://xeroxalto.computerhistory.org/index.html <br />
Unfortunately, the font files are in binary and to be used in the application .ttf files are required. <br />
Luckily, a few other people enjoy the aesthetics of the old Xerox machines and have created some fonts based on the Xerox Alto font. Here is a reference image of the Xerox terminal in action.

Damien Guard, a software engineer from France created a fantastic replica of the font, which can seen here:

There are no good images of the 'menu' screen where a player would choose their name, however we can likely assume that this is using the same system font as the standard terminal. Here is a screenshot from a 240p youtube video of the name-select screen. It is very low quality, but you can see the serifs on a number of the letters, and it seems to look similar to the Xerox Font above.

Unfortunately, the terminal font and the in-game font are slightly different.

This screenshot of the score's in a game shows the subtle difference between the two fonts. For example, the Xerox Alto font's 'l' has serifs, while the 'l' in the game does not.
##Alternative
Luckily for us, Damien Guard has created a few other fonts, one of which is almost indistinguishable from the in game font using the selected letters.

His 8pt PalmOS font is perfect for what we need, here is a comparison from the recreation of Maze War.

While there are a few differences (like the number 1), they are only really noticeable with a side by side comparison.<br /><br />
None of this would be possible without the amazing work of Damien Guard, check out more of his work here: https://damieng.com
