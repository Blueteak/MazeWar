#Game UI Layout
##Xerox Alto Platform
While the original Maze War was created for NASA's Imlacs machine, this is a recreation of the 1977 Xerox Alto version. The alto has a unique feature compared to today's computers in that its screen is taller than it is wide.

It has a 3:4 aspect ration (606 pixels by 808 pixels)

##Reference Material
Reference material for the 1977 version is surprisingly hard to find. A version for the Xeros Star machine was created slightly later, which is the bulk of search results for the original Maze War.<br /> There is, however, a youtube video of the game being played on the Alto (https://youtu.be/7chDIySXK2Q). Much of the video is portions of the screen or viewed at an angle, however a few frames of the games screen can be seen from the front.

##Measurements
Blowing the Alto screenshot up to fill a 606 x 808 image, we can trace the lines for the important parts of the UI, mainly the 3D view, the Maze Map, and the Score Text.

Now that we have a pixel scale replica of the game, we can measure the pixel offsets of the components.
